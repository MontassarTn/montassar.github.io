## Projects

### CAR PENALTY AUTOMATION
Our solution automates car penalty management for Swiss Premium Negoce by employing Surya OCR for text extraction from images, followed by fine-tuning with LORA Mistral AI to ensure accurate extraction of relevant data in XML format, This streamlined process enhances efficiency and accuracy in determining penalty liability.

### Object Detection Using Adaptive Mask R-CNN in Optical Remote Sensing Images
In this project, we focused on enhancing object detection in optical remote sensing images through the utilization of Adaptive Mask R-CNN. Our approach involved fine-tuning Mask R-CNN using PyTorch on satellite imagery to achieve precise image segmentation and object detection. Despite the given data consisting solely of bounding boxes for object classes and corresponding images, we implemented a novel process. We leveraged transformers, specifically SAM-ViT-Huge, to process these bounding boxes, generating masks for each object. These masks were then fed into Mask R-CNN for training, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of object detection in remote sensing imagery.
