## Projects

### CHATBOT ASSISTANT
Develop a sophisticated chatbot AI assistant designed to listen in on conversations between support staff and customers, guiding and assisting the supporter in resolving customer issues. This system utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with parent document retrieval for enhanced information access. Additionally, it incorporates a memory workflow involving two language models (LLMs): the first LLM analyzes input while reviewing conversation history to generate a new input based on past interactions. The second LLM then takes the output of the first, along with contextual data from the RAG, to formulate responses drawing on previous conversations, without relying on external knowledge. 
-Technologies: Vertex AI, LangChain, Gemini 1.5-Pro.

### CAR PENALTY AUTOMATION
Our solution automates car penalty management for Swiss Premium Negoce by employing Surya OCR for text extraction from images, followed by fine-tuning with LORA Mistral AI to ensure accurate extraction of relevant data in XML format, This streamlined process enhances efficiency and accuracy in determining penalty liability.

### Object Detection Using Adaptive Mask R-CNN in Optical Remote Sensing Images
We focused on enhancing object detection in optical remote sensing images through the utilization of Adaptive Mask R-CNN. Our approach involved fine-tuning Mask R-CNN using PyTorch on satellite imagery to achieve precise image segmentation and object detection. Despite the given data consisting solely of bounding boxes for object classes and corresponding images, we implemented a novel process. We leveraged transformers, specifically SAM-ViT-Huge, to process these bounding boxes, generating masks for each object. These masks were then fed into Mask R-CNN for training.

### Intrusion Detection Systems
Mastering machine learning methods is considered the primary approach in intrusion detection.
